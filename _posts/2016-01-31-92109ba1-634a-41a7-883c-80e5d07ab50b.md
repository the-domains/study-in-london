_As an international student planning their arrival in London, one of the most stressful things you have to do is find somewhere nice to live. Many people say London is one of the most expensive cities to come and study in, but the truth is there is a wide range of accommodation in London, to suit many people's budgets._

Standard Student Residences (£175-275 per week)

These residences are probably the perfect start to your life in London. Mid-range prices usually located in zones 2 or 3 in London but close to public transport. You get your own en-suite room, shared kitchen facilities, laundry, highspeed internet and all energy bills included in your weekly fee.

Sharing a house (£125-£250 per week per person) - This is definitely the most affordable option, and can be even cheaper if you don't have a problem sharing your room with another student. Gumtree is the best marketplace for room sharing in London, however we would always recommend you arrive in London first, arrange some short term accommodation and then actually visit houses you are interested in and meeting the people you may end up living with. Other sites like [Easy Roommate][2] and [Spare Room][3] are good places to start your search.
